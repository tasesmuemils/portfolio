        My name is Emils Bisenieks and I am learning front-end web development.
        I hope this page will help to understand my skills and see me as a
        possible hire.{" "}

        Since I remember, I always was fascinated how things work on the web. At
        school, I wasn't very interested to do something about it, but one day I
        just started to explore. Since beginning my journey of learning web
        development, I have read books, done tutorials, following front-end
        forums and news. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and
        perpetually working on improving my chops one problem at a time.
